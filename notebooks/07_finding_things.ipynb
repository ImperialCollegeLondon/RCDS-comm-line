    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I find files?\n",
    "- How can I find text in files?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Use **`grep`** to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.\n",
    "- Use **`find`** to find files and directories whose names match simple patterns.\n",
    "- Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.\n",
    "- Explain what is meant by ‘text’ and ‘binary’ files, and why many common tools don’t handle the latter well.\n",
