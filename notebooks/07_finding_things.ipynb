    "This notebook is based on a snapshot of [Episode 7](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/07-find/index.html) of the [Unix Shell lesson](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/) from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org). The original material has more detail.\n",

    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I find files?\n",
    "- How can I find text in files?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Use **`grep`** to select lines from text files that match simple patterns.\n",
    "- Use **`find`** to find files and directories whose names match simple patterns.\n",
    "- Use the output of one command as the command-line argument(s) to another command.\n",
    "- Explain what is meant by ‘text’ and ‘binary’ files, and why many common tools don’t handle the latter well.\n",

    "A handful of tools extend grep to handle a few non text formats. But a more generalizable approach is to convert the data to text, or extract the text-like elements from the data. On the one hand, it makes simple things easy to do. On the other hand, complex things are usually impossible. For example, it’s easy enough to write a program that will extract X and Y dimensions from image files for grep to play with, but how would you write something to find values in a spreadsheet whose cells contained formulas?\n",
    "A last option is to recognize that the shell and text processing have their limits, and to use another programming language. When the time comes to do this, don’t be too hard on the shell: many modern programming languages have borrowed a lot of ideas from it, and imitation is also the sincerest form of praise."
