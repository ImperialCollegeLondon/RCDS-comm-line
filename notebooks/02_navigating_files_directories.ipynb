    "# Episode 2 - Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "This notebook is based on a snapshot of [Episode 2](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html) of the [Unix Shell lesson](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/) from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org). The original material has more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I move around on my computer?\n",
    "- How can I see what files and directories I have?\n",
    "- How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa.\n",
    "- Construct absolute and relative paths that identify specific files and directories.\n",
    "- Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command\n",
