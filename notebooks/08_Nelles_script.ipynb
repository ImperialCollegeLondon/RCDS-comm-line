    "\n",
    "This notebook is an extension to the [Unix Shell lesson](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/) from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org). It decribes how to develop a shell script to solve an example problem that was outlined in [Episode 1](https://kmichali.github.io/SC-shell-novice/01-intro/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How do you run a program on ~1500 data files using the command line?\n",
    "- How do you make your script user-friendly?\n",
    "- How do you check if the data files are valid?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files.\n",
    "- Learn about the fundamental scripting building blocks - loops, variables and conditionals.\n",
    "- Learn about argument validation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nelle Nemo, a marine biologist, has just returned from a six-month survey of the [North Pacific Gyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Pacific_Gyre), where she has been sampling gelatinous marine life in the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch). She has 1520 samples that she’s run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. She needs to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called **`goostats`** she inherited. On top of this huge task, she has to write up results by the end of the month so her paper can appear in a special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bad news is that if she has to run **`goostats`** by hand using a GUI, she’ll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If **`goostats`** takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours of Nelle’s attention. With the shell, Nelle can instead assign her computer this mundane task while she focuses her attention on writing her paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few lessons will explore the ways Nelle can achieve this. More specifically, they explain how she can use a command shell to run the **`goostats`** program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that her computer can work while she writes her paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bonus, once she has put a processing pipeline together, she will be able to use it again whenever she collects more data."
