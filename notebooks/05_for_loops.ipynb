    "### Questions:\n",
    "- How can I perform the same actions on many different files?\n",

    "### Objectives:\n",
    "- Write a loop that applies one or more commands separately to each file in a set of files.\n",
    "- Trace the values taken on by a loop variable during execution of the loop.\n",
    "- Explain the difference between a variable’s name and its value.\n",
